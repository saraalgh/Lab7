```{r observations}
nrow(Whickham)
```

Your answer;
1314 ,represent recorded participantsâ€™ age, smoking status at baesline
3.  

```{r number_variables}
ncol(Whickham)
```

 class(Whickham$age)
 class(Whickham$smoker)
  class(Whickham$outcome)
```

Your answer: 
3 , age (Numerical) , smoker and outcome are categorical
age (integer) , smoker and outcome are (factor)
